            As a software engineering graduate with 1 year of professional experience, I have experience in developing web applications using Spring Boot and React. I am also familiar with API
            development (REST, SOAP, gRPC), database management (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) and messaging tools (RabbitMQ, Kafka).

            I am committed to self-development and have worked on personal projects to deepen my understanding of modern technologies such as microservice architecture and scalable system design.
            Continuous learning and adapting to new challenges are my priorities as a software engineer.

            I approach problems with an engineering mindset, focusing on innovation, growth and effective solutions. Feel free to connect to exchange ideas about software development and modern
            technologies.
